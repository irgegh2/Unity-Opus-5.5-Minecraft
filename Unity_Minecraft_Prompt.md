## Mission

You are the sole lead developer of this Unity project.

Your task is to build the closest practical **single-player recreation of modern Minecraft: Java Edition** that can be achieved inside this project during this autonomous coding session.

This is not a tiny voxel-tech-demo task and not an MVP-only task. The goal is to recreate as much of the recognizable Minecraft experience as possible: world generation, visuals, controls, Creative, Survival, inventories, crafting, mobs, combat, portals, the Nether, the End, bosses, structures, redstone-like systems, progression, and modern content.

The project will be shown in a YouTube video comparing how well Claude Opus 5.5 can recreate Minecraft in several game engines. Therefore:

- visible fidelity matters;
- breadth of working gameplay matters;
- the first-launch experience matters;
- funny/broken placeholders are worse than fewer systems that genuinely work;
- after the stable core works, keep adding content instead of stopping at a minimal milestone.

I am a complete Unity beginner. Do not expect me to manually configure scenes, prefabs, materials, ScriptableObjects, UI, input maps, lighting, physics settings, or Inspector values for you. **Automate everything that can reasonably be automated.**

Do not merely write instructions for me. Modify the actual project and leave it ready to open and play.


## Mandatory Blender MCP integration — overrides later optional Blender wording

Blender is a **mandatory active 3D asset-production tool for this benchmark**.

The dedicated Blender connection for this Unity project is:

```text
MCP server: blender_unity
Blender port: 9876
Master Blender file: UnityMinecraft.blend
```

Use **only** `blender_unity` for this project. Do not use `blender_godot` or `blender_unreal`.

If any later section of this prompt says that Blender is optional, not required, or should only be used for selected complex assets, **this section takes precedence**. Blender MCP is the primary authoring pipeline for important visible 3D assets.

### Visual target for Blender-authored assets

For the Unity version, Blender-created assets should stay extremely close to the **classic Minecraft 3D visual language** already requested by this prompt.

Do **not** reinterpret the game as realistic, smooth, cinematic, Roblox-like, or generic low-poly art.

For mobs, items, tools, weapons, armor, boats, minecarts, bosses, functional blocks and other authored 3D content:

- preserve Minecraft-like block/cuboid construction;
- preserve recognizable silhouettes;
- preserve approximate body-part proportions and relative scale;
- preserve the flat/blocky geometry language;
- preserve the pixel-art material language already required elsewhere in this prompt;
- make each asset immediately recognizable as the Minecraft-style object/mob it represents;
- obey the intellectual-property rule in this prompt: create the assets yourself and do not extract/copy Mojang/Microsoft meshes, textures or other shipped files.

The goal is **very close visual form and proportions, recreated from scratch**, not a different artistic interpretation.

### What should use Blender

Use Blender MCP actively for important authored 3D models, including where relevant:

- player/body model and visible body parts;
- mobs and mob variants;
- Ender Dragon;
- Wither;
- tools;
- swords and other weapons;
- bows/crossbows;
- shields;
- tridents/spears;
- armor visuals;
- boats;
- minecarts;
- chests and other functional objects whose 3D form benefits from authored geometry;
- torches, lanterns, campfires and similar props;
- End crystals and boss-related props;
- complex decorative/interactive blocks;
- held-item 3D geometry;
- any other major visible model that would otherwise remain an engine primitive or weak placeholder.

Simple voxel terrain still needs the efficient chunk-mesh system required elsewhere in the prompt. Do **not** replace the runtime voxel world with one Blender mesh per block. For ordinary cube blocks, Blender may be used to establish canonical proportions/UV/material references, while runtime terrain should still be merged/generated efficiently by Unity.

### Required Blender workflow

For every important Blender-authored asset:

1. use `blender_unity` to inspect/create/edit the asset;
2. keep the work inside or saved back into `UnityMinecraft.blend`;
3. use meaningful object/collection names;
4. set scale, transforms, pivots/origins and part hierarchy correctly;
5. create UV/material assignments where appropriate;
6. create articulation/rigging or separated moving parts where animation requires it;
7. visually inspect the result in Blender and revise obvious proportion/silhouette problems;
8. save the `.blend`;
9. export using a reliable Unity-friendly format, preferably FBX for rigged/animated assets and FBX/GLB where appropriate for static assets;
10. import the exported asset into the Unity project automatically;
11. configure materials, colliders, animation, Prefabs and gameplay components;
12. verify the result inside Unity before considering the asset complete.

A Blender asset is **not complete merely because it exists in Blender**. It must be integrated and usable in the running game.

### Safe Mode / automation

The Blender MCP may be running in Safe Mode. Work within the tools that are available:

- prefer direct structured MCP operations;
- use Blender-native save/export operations;
- adapt the workflow instead of abandoning Blender;
- do not ask me to disable Safe Mode merely for convenience.

Only report Safe Mode as a blocker if a genuinely necessary Blender operation cannot be completed by any allowed MCP/native workflow.

Do not ask me to manually model, rig, export, import or assemble these assets when the connected Blender MCP and Unity automation can do it.

# 0. Reference target and scope

## Target Minecraft version

Use **Minecraft: Java Edition 26.2** as the gameplay/content reference target.

Reference date for this benchmark: **2026-09-12**.

Minecraft Java 26.2 is the current stable target for this task. Do **not** treat 26.3 release-candidate / unreleased Wilderness Bound content as required baseline content.

The recreation should feel primarily like Java Edition.

## Intellectual-property / asset rule

Recreate Minecraft's **gameplay systems, proportions, interaction model, progression structure, UI concepts, block-world feel, and recognizable feature behavior** as closely as practical, but:

- do not copy or decompile Mojang/Microsoft source code;
- do not extract or redistribute original Minecraft texture files;
- do not copy original sound files, music, fonts, logos, title art, or other shipped game assets;
- do not download ripped asset packs;
- create the implementation from scratch;
- create original procedural/generated pixel textures, sounds, icons, and blocky models that are visually close in *format and feel* without copying source assets pixel-for-pixel.

A 16×16-ish pixel-art texture style, cubic/blocky mobs, Minecraft-like UI layout and proportions, and recognizable mechanics are desired.

---

# 1. Autonomy rules

You own the implementation.

Before coding:

1. Inspect the entire project.
2. Read `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` and identify the exact Unity version.
3. Identify the active render pipeline and installed packages.
4. Check whether this is already a Git repository.
5. If Git is available and the repository is not initialized:
   - create a Unity-appropriate `.gitignore`;
   - initialize Git;
   - create a baseline commit before major modifications.
6. Create `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `FEATURE_MATRIX.md`.
7. Record the session start timestamp as described in the Metrics section at the end of this prompt.

Then work autonomously.

### Do not pause between phases

Do not ask me for confirmation after every milestone.

Continue from phase to phase automatically until:
- the requested scope is implemented as far as practical;
- you hit a genuine tool/permission/environment blocker;
- or the coding session is ending.

If one feature is difficult, do not get stuck indefinitely. Preserve the working game, document the issue, move to the next high-value feature, and return later if possible.

### Do not offload Unity work to me

Prefer:
- runtime bootstrap code;
- Editor scripts;
- asset-generation scripts;
- automatic scene generation;
- automatic prefab/material creation;
- code-driven configuration.

Avoid instructions like:
> "Create this GameObject manually and drag this reference into the Inspector."

If a scene/prefab/material can be generated by an Editor script, generate it.

---

# 2. Completion philosophy

This is a **breadth + fidelity benchmark**, not a minimal prototype.

Use this priority order:

1. Stable playable voxel core.
2. Creative mode that is excellent for rapidly demonstrating the project.
3. Survival mode with authentic progression.
4. Overworld quality and recognizable Minecraft systems.
5. Functional Nether portal + substantial Nether.
6. Functional End progression + substantial End + Ender Dragon.
7. Broad mob coverage.
8. Broad crafting/item/block coverage.
9. Structures, redstone, farming, enchanting, brewing, vehicles and other systems.
10. Modern Minecraft 26.2-era content and visual polish.

**Do not stop after item 1 or 2.** Keep implementing the later priorities while the project remains stable.

When forced to choose, a feature that visibly works in a YouTube recording is more valuable than an invisible internal edge case.

Do not implement menu entries or fake items that claim to work but are completely nonfunctional. Decorative blocks can be decorative; interactive/survival-critical items should have real behavior.

---

# 3. Core technical architecture

Build a modular, data-driven system.

Suggested high-level folders:

```text
Assets/
  _Game/
    World/
    Voxels/
    Biomes/
    Dimensions/
    Structures/
    Player/
    Blocks/
    Items/
    Inventory/
    Crafting/
    Entities/
    Mobs/
    AI/
    Combat/
    Farming/
    Redstone/
    Portals/
    UI/
    Audio/
    SaveSystem/
    Debug/
    Generated/
    Editor/
    Tests/
```

Use clean namespaces where practical.

Create registries/data definitions for:
- blocks;
- items;
- recipes;
- mobs;
- biomes;
- structures;
- dimensions;
- loot tables;
- status effects;
- enchantments.

Do not hardcode every variant into huge switch statements if a data-driven solution is practical.

---

# 4. Voxel world engine

## Coordinate and block model

Target:
- 1 Unity unit ≈ 1 Minecraft block;
- axis-aligned cubic voxel grid;
- player approximately Minecraft scale;
- chunk footprint **16×16 blocks**;
- use vertical chunk sections/subchunks if needed.

Modern Minecraft Java uses a large vertical range. Attempt a world range comparable to **Y -64 through 320** if performance and implementation complexity allow. If a reduced range is required for stability, keep coordinate semantics and terrain proportions believable and document the difference.

## Rendering

Do NOT create one GameObject per terrain block.

Implement:
- chunk mesh generation;
- hidden-face culling;
- texture atlas or texture-array based materials;
- separate transparent/fluid geometry where useful;
- neighbor-aware chunk updates;
- chunk dirty/rebuild system;
- mesh collision;
- configurable render distance.

Greedy meshing, Jobs/Burst, async generation, pooling, or background data generation are encouraged if practical, but do not destabilize the project merely for theoretical optimization.

Target smooth gameplay at a useful recording distance on a normal gaming PC.

## World generation

The Overworld must be seed-based and deterministic.

Generate:
- large terrain variation;
- plains;
- hills;
- mountains;
- valleys;
- coastlines;
- oceans;
- rivers where practical;
- caves;
- underground ore distribution;
- underground lava;
- water level;
- trees and vegetation;
- biome transitions.

Prefer multi-noise/fractal noise rather than one simplistic height map.

### Important Overworld biomes

Implement as many as possible, with **visually distinct terrain and vegetation**, prioritizing:

- Plains
- Forest
- Birch Forest
- Dark Forest
- Taiga
- Snowy Taiga
- Snowy Plains
- Desert
- Savanna
- Jungle
- Bamboo Jungle
- Swamp
- Mangrove Swamp
- Badlands
- Meadow
- Windswept Hills / mountain terrain
- Jagged/Frozen/Stony Peaks style mountains
- Cherry Grove
- Pale Garden
- Beach / Stony Shore
- River / Frozen River
- Ocean
- Warm Ocean
- Cold/Frozen Ocean
- Mushroom Fields
- Lush Caves
- Dripstone Caves
- Deep Dark
- Sulfur Caves

After these, add additional biome variants if time permits.

### Modern 26.2 content note

Minecraft Java 26.2 includes the **Sulfur Caves** biome and **Sulfur Cube**. Sulfur Caves are an underground biome with sulfur/cinnabar bands, sulfur pools, potent sulfur, sulfur spikes and geyser-like behavior. Treat this as modern stretch content after the major vanilla progression is stable.

---

# 5. Blocks and materials

Create a broad block registry and a coherent original pixel-art texture atlas.

At minimum support the major Minecraft block families needed for gameplay:

### Terrain / natural
- grass block
- dirt
- coarse dirt
- podzol
- mud
- stone
- cobblestone
- deepslate
- cobbled deepslate
- granite
- diorite
- andesite
- tuff
- calcite
- sand
- red sand

- crying obsidian

### Ores / resources
- coal ore
- copper ore
- iron ore
- gold ore
- redstone ore
- lapis ore
- diamond ore
- emerald ore
- deepslate variants where practical
- raw resource blocks
- coal block
- iron block
- copper block family

### Wood families
Support multiple wood types with logs, planks and useful variants:
- oak

- saplings;
- stairs;
- slabs;
- doors;
- trapdoors;
- fences;
- fence gates;
- buttons;
- pressure plates;
- signs if practical.

### Functional blocks
Implement actual interaction for as many as possible:
- crafting table
- furnace
- blast furnace
- smoker
- chest
- trapped chest
- barrel
- ender chest
- shulker box
- anvil
- enchanting table
- brewing stand
- smithing table
- stonecutter
- loom
- grindstone
- composter
- lectern
- bookshelf
- chiseled bookshelf
- bed
- torch
- soul torch
- lantern
- campfire
- ladder
- scaffolding
- glass
- glass panes
- TNT
- jukebox as decorative/interactive if audio permits
- spawner
- beacon
- respawn anchor

### Modern copper family
Current target-era content includes:
- copper equipment tier;
- copper chest;
- copper golem;
- copper decorative variants;
- copper torch/lantern/bars/chains where practical;
- shelf blocks;
- oxidation/waxing as stretch behavior.

### Nether blocks
- netherrack
- soul sand
- soul soil
- basalt
- blackstone
- magma
- glowstone
- Nether quartz ore
- Nether gold ore
- ancient debris
- crimson nylium
- warped nylium
- crimson/warped stems and planks
- Nether wart
- shroomlight
- vines/roots/fungi approximations
- lava

### End blocks
- end stone
- purpur
- chorus plant/flower
- obsidian pillars
- end portal frame
- end portal
- end gateway
- end crystal

### 26.2 blocks as stretch
- sulfur
- potent sulfur
- cinnabar
- polished/brick variants
- sulfur spikes

Do not artificially cap the block catalog. Once the core families work, use generators/data definitions to add decorative variants efficiently.

# 6. First-person player controls

Match Minecraft keyboard/mouse behavior closely.

Default controls:

- Mouse — look
- `WASD` — move
- `Space` — jump
- `Left Ctrl` — sprint
- `Left Shift` — sneak / descend while flying
- `Left Mouse` — attack / mine
- `Right Mouse` — use / place / eat / interact
- `1`–`9` — hotbar slots
- Mouse wheel — hotbar selection
- `E` — inventory
- `Q` — drop selected item
- `F` — swap main hand/offhand if offhand exists
- Middle Mouse — pick block in Creative
- Double-tap `Space` — toggle Creative flight
- `Space` while flying — ascend
- `Shift` while flying — descend
- `Esc` — pause
- `F3` — debug overlay
- `F3 + F4` or a similarly reliable shortcut — game-mode switcher

Implement:
- walking;
- sprinting;
- jumping;
- sneaking;
- step-up behavior where reasonable;
- gravity;
- fall damage in Survival;
- swimming;
- underwater movement;
- water surface behavior;
- camera bob;
- held-item bob/swing;
- mining/attack hand animation;
- collision with blocks;
- head clearance;
- no clipping through chunk borders.

---

# 7. Block interaction and mining

Implement Minecraft-like targeting:

- raycast from camera;
- clear block outline/selection box;
- reach distance similar to Minecraft;
- adjacent-face placement;
- prevent placing a solid block inside the player's collider;
- correct placement across chunk boundaries.

## Creative behavior
- instant block breaking;
- no drops required from creative destruction;
- unlimited placement;
- items do not get consumed;
- tools do not lose durability.

## Survival behavior
Blocks have:
- hardness;
- preferred tool type;
- minimum tool tier when relevant;
- mining speed;
- drop rules;
- Silk Touch/Fortune hooks where implemented;
- blast resistance;
- transparency/solid/fluid flags.

Mining should visibly progress with crack/progress feedback if feasible.

Breaking or placing a boundary block must rebuild all affected chunks correctly.

---

# 8. Game modes — extremely important

The project must include **Creative and Survival** as real separate modes.

## Default mode: CREATIVE

When a new/default benchmark world launches, the player should begin in **Creative mode**.

Creative should behave as close as practical to Minecraft Java:

- effectively unlimited resources;
- invulnerability;
- no hunger requirement;
- instant block breaking;
- free block/item placement;
- unlimited item use;
- flight;
- double-space flight toggle;
- hostile mobs do not target/attack the Creative player under ordinary conditions;
- access to a searchable Creative inventory.

### Creative inventory

This is one of the most important features for the YouTube test.

Pressing `E` in Creative should open a polished Minecraft-like Creative inventory with:

- search field;
- scrollable catalog;
- category tabs;
- item tooltips;
- click/drag behavior sufficient for quick use;
- hotbar integration;
- stack creation;
- destroy/clear-item action.

Use categories similar to Java:
- Building Blocks
- Colored Blocks
- Natural Blocks
- Functional Blocks
- Redstone Blocks
- Tools & Utilities
- Combat
- Food & Drinks
- Ingredients
- Spawn Eggs / Mobs
- Search
- Survival Inventory

### Any item

The Creative inventory must allow the player to obtain **every implemented item/block** immediately.

### Any mob

Creative must provide a convenient way to spawn **every implemented mob**.

Use spawn eggs or an equivalent dedicated Mob/Spawn tab.

For this benchmark, go slightly beyond strict vanilla limitations if necessary: even bosses such as the Wither and Ender Dragon should have a direct test-spawn mechanism in Creative/debug UI so that I can rapidly demonstrate them on video.

A separate searchable `All Mobs` panel is acceptable in addition to spawn eggs.

## Survival mode

Survival must not expose the Creative item/spawn catalog.

Survival starts from normal resource constraints:
- empty/basic inventory on a fresh survival start;
- no flight;
- no invulnerability;
- finite items;
- mining time;
- tool requirements;
- item durability;
- health;
- hunger;
- drowning;
- fall/fire/lava/starvation damage;
- hostile mob aggression;
- death and respawn;
- resource gathering;
- crafting progression;
- XP;
- armor;
- food;
- natural regeneration rules approximately matching Java.

Default Survival difficulty: **Normal**.

Add Peaceful/Easy/Normal/Hard if practical.

### Survival HUD
Show:
- 10-heart style health bar / 20 health points;
- hunger bar;
- armor bar when relevant;
- oxygen bubbles underwater;
- XP bar and level;
- 9-slot hotbar;
- selected item count/durability where useful.

Implement hunger/saturation behavior close enough to vanilla that:
- movement/sprinting consumes exhaustion;
- low hunger stops sprinting;
- sufficient hunger allows natural health regeneration;
- zero hunger causes starvation damage depending on difficulty.

### Death and respawn
- death screen;
- inventory drops at death in Survival;
- respawn at world spawn or last valid bed/respawn anchor;
- dropped items persist long enough to recover;
- Creative player normally cannot die except exceptional debug/void behavior.

### Mode switching
Provide a polished quick game-mode switcher for testing.
`F3+F4` is preferred because it mirrors Java Edition.

Switching to Survival must immediately remove Creative-only privileges/menu access.

---

# 9. Inventory and item system

Implement a Minecraft-like inventory model:

- 9-slot hotbar;
- main inventory rows;
- stack sizes;
- drag/drop;
- split stacks;
- shift-click where practical;
- item dropping;
- pickups;
- armor slots;
- offhand;
- container inventories.

Survival inventory should include a **2×2 crafting grid**.

Crafting table should provide a **3×3 crafting grid**.

Add:
- chests;
- double-chest behavior if feasible;
- furnaces;
- storage containers;
- item entities;
- pickup delay;
- stack merging where practical.

---

# 10. Crafting, smelting and progression

Minecraft 26.2 has a very large recipe set. Do not try to hand-author every recipe one by one if a data-driven family/generator can create them.

The goal is **as many real, useful recipes as practical**, not 10 showcase recipes.

Implement:
- shaped recipes;
- shapeless recipes;
- ingredient tags/families where useful;
- output counts;
- recipe lookup/book UI if practical.

High-priority recipes include:

### Basic progression
- planks from logs
- sticks
- crafting table
- chest
- furnace
- torches
- bed
- ladders
- doors
- fences
- slabs/stairs
- glass
- buckets
- flint and steel

### Tool/equipment tiers
Support:
- wood
- stone
- copper
- iron
- gold
- diamond
- netherite

For relevant tiers:
- pickaxe
- axe
- shovel
- hoe
- sword
- armor pieces

Copper should sit between stone and iron in general equipment progression, reflecting modern Minecraft's Copper Age.

### Combat/utility
- bow
- arrows
- crossbow if practical
- shield
- shears
- fishing rod if implemented
- compass
- clock
- minecart
- boat
- TNT
- ender chest
- eye of ender
- end crystal
- beacon
- fireworks for Elytra
- spear

### Stations
Implement:
- furnace smelting and fuel;
- smoker/blast furnace as variants if practical;
- smithing table for netherite upgrades;
- anvil repair/rename basics;
- brewing stand;
- enchanting table.

### Recipe book
A searchable recipe book is desirable, especially in Survival.

Continue adding recipe families after the high-priority progression is complete.

---

- knockback;
- death animations/effects;
- ranged projectiles;
- shields blocking;
- mob damage;
- difficulty scaling;
- critical-hit hooks if practical.

---

# 12. Food, health, status and survival systems

Implement a useful food set:
- apple
- bread
- raw/cooked beef
- raw/cooked pork
- raw/cooked chicken
- raw/cooked mutton
- fish
- potato/baked potato
- carrot

- golden apple
- berries or equivalent

Food restores hunger and saturation.

Implement:
- health;
- hunger;
- saturation;
- oxygen;
- fire;
- burning;
- drowning;
- lava;
- fall damage;
- poison;
- regeneration;
- resistance/speed/strength hooks for potions.

---

# 13. Farming and world interaction

Add as many recognizable survival systems as practical:

- farmland created with hoe;
- wheat;
- carrots;
- potatoes;
- sugar cane;
- cactus;
- pumpkins/melons if practical;
- crop growth/random ticks;
- bone meal;
- sapling growth;
- leaves decay;
- animal breeding;

- milking cows if buckets exist;
- fishing as stretch.

### Animal interactions
Implement recognizable taming/breeding hooks when practical:
- wolves + bones;
- cats;
- horses;
- animals attracted/bred by appropriate foods.

---

# 14. Fluids

Water and lava should be more than static colored cubes.

Implement practical voxel-fluid behavior:
- source blocks;
- short-range flow/spread;
- water swimming;
- buoyancy feel;
- drowning/oxygen;
- lava damage;
- lava ignition;
- water extinguishes fire;
- buckets can pick up/place source fluids.

Stretch interactions:
- water + lava -> cobblestone/stone/obsidian depending on conditions;
- Nether water evaporation.

Visuals:
- transparent water;
- animated or moving texture/UV if feasible;
- underwater color/fog;
- lava emissive material.

---

# 15. Day/night, weather and lighting

Implement:
- Minecraft-like day/night cycle;
- square-ish sun and moon presentation using original textures;
- sky color changes;
- stars;
- ambient light changes;
- fog;
- sunrise/sunset;
- mob spawning response to darkness/time.

Stretch:
- rain;
- snow;
- thunderstorms;
- lightning.

Beds should:
- set spawn in Overworld;
- allow sleeping/skipping night when appropriate.

Beds used in the Nether or End should behave dangerously/explosively, like Minecraft.

---

# 16. Mob system

Use a reusable AI/entity framework with:
- health;
- movement;
- pathing/steering;
- gravity where applicable;
- target selection;
- aggression state;
- attacks;
- damage;
- drops;
- XP;
- sounds/hooks;
- spawn rules;
- despawning rules where useful.

Mobs must not all behave like the same capsule with different colors.

Create **blocky articulated models** from generated meshes/primitives with recognizable silhouettes and simple animation:
- idle;
- walk;
- attack;
- hurt;
- death;
- special actions where relevant.

Use original generated textures/materials.

# 17. Mob spawning

Implement natural spawning rules per dimension/biome/light at useful approximation.

In Survival:
- passive mobs in suitable biomes;
- hostile mobs primarily in darkness/night;
- Nether/End dimension-specific mobs;
- cap populations to protect performance.

In Creative:
- natural spawning may still exist;
- hostile mobs should not normally target the Creative player;
- any implemented mob must be spawnable instantly from Creative inventory/debug UI.

---

# 18. Loot and drops

Use data-driven loot tables.

Important examples:
- animals -> relevant food/material drops;
- sheep -> wool/mutton;
- chickens -> feathers/chicken;
- zombies -> rotten flesh;
- skeletons -> bones/arrows;
- creepers -> gunpowder;
- spiders -> string;
- endermen -> ender pearls;
- blazes -> blaze rods;
- ghasts -> ghast tears/gunpowder;
- wither skeletons -> bones/coal and rare skull;
- shulkers -> shulker shells;
- Ender Dragon -> XP + progression event;
- Wither -> Nether Star.

Loot should connect to crafting/progression.

---

# 19. STRUCTURES — Overworld

Generate structures procedurally or from code-created templates.

High priority:
- Village
- Mineshaft
- Stronghold with End portal room
- Ruined Portal

Then add as many as practical:
- Desert Pyramid
- Jungle Pyramid
- Pillager Outpost
- Woodland Mansion
- Swamp Hut
- Igloo
- Shipwreck
- Buried Treasure
- Ocean Ruins
- Ocean Monument
- Ancient City
- Trail Ruins
- Trial Chambers

Structures should have at least simplified believable loot/chests/mob relationships.

### Villages
Important features:
- houses/paths/farms;
- beds;
- villagers;
- simple professions;
- basic trading UI as stretch;
- Iron Golem presence.

### Stronghold
This is mandatory because Survival progression to the End must work.

Include:
- underground generated stronghold;
- portal room;
- End portal frame ring;
- ability to activate the portal using Eyes of Ender.

Eyes of Ender should provide a practical way of locating the nearest stronghold.

---

# 20. Nether portal — mandatory

A Survival player must be able to build and use a Nether portal.

Implement Minecraft-like portal rules:

- obsidian rectangular frame;
- minimum familiar portal shape roughly 4×5 outer dimensions / 2×3 opening;
- corner blocks may be optional if practical;
- activate using flint and steel/fire;
- animated purple-ish portal surface using original material;
- portal particles/ambient effect;
- short portal dwell/transition;
- teleport to Nether;
- return to Overworld;
- do not duplicate player or inventory;
- world state persists in both dimensions.

Use Minecraft-like horizontal coordinate scaling:
- Overworld -> Nether: X/Z approximately divided by 8;
- Nether -> Overworld: X/Z approximately multiplied by 8.

Find or generate a safe destination portal if one does not already exist nearby.

---

# 21. THE NETHER — mandatory

The Nether must feel like a real separate dimension, not a red room.

Generate a persistent voxel world with:
- large cavernous terrain;
- bedrock-like floor/ceiling behavior;
- lava oceans;
- glowstone;
- quartz;
- Nether gold;
- ancient debris;
- biome fog/particles;
- Nether structures;
- Nether mob spawning.

Implement the five major Nether biome identities:

1. Nether Wastes
2. Crimson Forest
3. Warped Forest
4. Soul Sand Valley
5. Basalt Deltas

### Nether structures
Mandatory/high priority:
- Nether Fortress
- Blaze spawner area
- Bastion Remnant

Stretch:
- ruined portals;
- Nether fossils.

### Nether gameplay
Include:
- piglins;
- hoglins;
- ghasts;
- blazes;
- wither skeletons;
- magma cubes;
- striders;
- zombified piglins;
- endermen where appropriate.

Important behaviors:
- water should not behave normally in the Nether;
- beds explode;
- respawn anchor can provide Nether respawn if implemented;
- lava is common;
- Netherite progression via ancient debris;
- blaze rods enable Eyes of Ender/progression.

---

# 22. End progression and End portal — mandatory

Survival progression should be possible:

1. Obtain ender pearls.
2. Obtain blaze powder.
3. Craft Eyes of Ender.
4. Use Eyes to locate a stronghold.
5. Find the End portal room.
6. Insert Eyes into portal frames.
7. Activate the portal.
8. Enter the End.

Creative should also provide:
- End Portal Frame;
- Eye of Ender;
- direct debug/teleport options for testing.

The active End portal should be a 3×3 portal area inside the familiar frame structure.

Entering teleports immediately to the End and creates/uses a safe obsidian arrival platform.

---

# 23. THE END — mandatory

The End must contain:

### Main island
- void;
- large End Stone central island;
- Endermen;
- obsidian pillars;
- End Crystals;
- central exit portal/fountain;
- Ender Dragon boss.

### Ender Dragon fight
This is a headline YouTube feature. Make it visually and mechanically convincing.

Implement:
- boss health bar;
- flying/orbiting behavior;
- attacks/fireball or dragon-breath approximation;
- periodic perching near central portal;
- obsidian pillars;
- End Crystals that heal the dragon;
- destroying crystals matters;
- death sequence/particles;
- large XP reward or visible reward;
- exit portal activates after victory.

### After dragon defeat
Implement:
- return portal;
- End Gateway;
- access to outer islands.

### Outer End
Generate:
- large/small floating End islands;
- chorus plants;
- End Cities;
- Shulkers;
- End Ships;
- Elytra loot.

### Elytra
If practical:
- equipable;
- glide/fly physics;
- fireworks boost.

This gives the End a real post-boss purpose.

---

# 24. Wither progression

Implement the Wither as the second boss.

Player should be able to summon it through a Minecraft-like construction using:
- soul sand/soil arrangement;
- three wither skeleton skulls.

Wither behavior:
- boss bar;
- flight;
- ranged explosive attacks;
- target mobs/player in Survival;
- multi-phase/armor-like behavior if practical;
- terrain damage;
- drops Nether Star.

Use Nether Star for a simplified functional Beacon system if time permits.

Creative mob menu must also allow direct Wither spawn for video testing.

---

# 25. Redstone-like system

Implement enough Minecraft redstone to demonstrate real circuits.

Core:
- redstone dust;
- redstone block;
- lever;
- button;
- pressure plate;
- redstone torch;
- redstone lamp;
- repeater;
- comparator if practical;
- piston;
- sticky piston;
- observer if practical;
- target block;
- TNT ignition;
- dispenser;
- dropper;
- hopper.

Aim for:
- power levels / propagation;
- wires visually connect;
- levers/buttons power nearby systems;
- lamps turn on;
- pistons push blocks within constraints;
- TNT can be triggered;
- repeater delays/signals.

A small working lever -> redstone -> lamp setup should definitely be possible.

---

# 26. Explosions and TNT

TNT must be satisfying.

Implement:
- placement;
- flint-and-steel ignition;
- redstone ignition;
- visible fuse;
- flashing/animation;
- fuse sound;
- particle explosion;
- screen/camera feedback if tasteful;
- radial entity damage;
- knockback;
- actual voxel terrain destruction based on blast strength;
- chain reactions.

Creeper and Ghast explosions should reuse the same robust explosion system with tuned strength.

---

# 27. Enchanting, XP, brewing and potions

After major progression is working, add:

## XP
- mob XP drops;
- XP orbs or direct equivalent;
- player XP bar and levels.

## Enchanting
- enchanting table UI;
- lapis cost;
- level cost;
- randomized useful enchantments.

High-value enchantments:
- Sharpness
- Protection
- Efficiency
- Unbreaking
- Fortune
- Silk Touch
- Power
- Infinity
- Mending if practical
- Lunge for spear as modern stretch feature

## Brewing
- brewing stand UI;
- blaze powder fuel;
- water bottles;
- Nether Wart -> awkward potion;
- a useful subset:
  - Healing
  - Regeneration
  - Strength
  - Speed
  - Fire Resistance
  - Night Vision

---

# 28. Transportation

Implement as much as practical:

High priority:
- boats;
- minecarts + rails.

Stretch:
- powered rails;
- chest minecart;
- horse riding;
- camel riding;
- strider riding with appropriate control item;
- Happy Ghast riding;
- Elytra.

Vehicles should not be decorative props if exposed as usable items.

---

# 29. Commands / admin/debug tools

For YouTube testing, add a Minecraft-like command console or debug interface.

Useful commands:
- `/gamemode creative`
- `/gamemode survival`
- `/give <item> [count]`
- `/summon <mob>`
- `/time set day`
- `/time set night`
- `/weather clear`
- `/tp`
- `/locate structure`
- `/locate biome`
- `/kill`
- `/difficulty`

A dedicated debug/admin panel is also welcome, but it must not replace the Creative inventory.

Creative/debug panel should allow:
- change dimension;
- teleport;
- set time;
- spawn every implemented mob;
- give every implemented item;
- toggle flight;
- clear entities;
- reload chunks;
- show seed;
- show XYZ;
- show biome;
- show chunk;
- show FPS.

The UI should make it fast for me to demonstrate features on camera.

---

# 30. Visual target

This should look immediately recognizable as a polished modern block-building sandbox and as close to Minecraft's visual grammar as practical without copying its shipped assets.

## World look
- original 16×16-ish pixel textures;
- strong readable block faces;
- grass top/side distinction;
- ore patterns;
- wood grain;
- leaves with transparency/cutout;
- animated water/lava approximation;
- square sun/moon;
- blue sky and fog;
- Minecraft-like color palette;
- biome tinting for grass/leaves/water if feasible.

## Mobs
Avoid primitive capsule placeholders in the final presentation.

Use:
- cube/rectangular body pieces;
- blocky heads/limbs;
- simple keyframe/procedural animations;
- recognizable proportions;
- original generated pixel materials.

## First-person items
Do not show all tools as flat icons.

Blocks/tools/weapons held in the hand should have:
- actual block mesh or simple 3D item/tool model;
- sensible first-person position;
- equip/bob;
- swing/use animation.

## UI
Create an original but Minecraft-like pixel UI:
- centered crosshair;
- 9-slot hotbar;
- selected slot frame;
- inventory grid;
- hearts/hunger/armor/XP in Survival;
- clean Creative catalog.

Do not use the official Minecraft logo or copied UI sprite sheets.

---


# 30A. Mandatory Asset Generation Pipeline

You are responsible for creating the visual assets required by the game.

Do **not** leave final gameplay using generic Unity primitive placeholders such as:

- Capsule mobs;
- plain cubes with flat colors and no authored block textures;
- generic spheres/cylinders used as final creature models;
- flat-colored materials used as final art;
- placeholder UI rectangles;
- flat 2D sprites pretending to be held 3D tools;
- missing-texture magenta materials;
- default Unity checkerboard/debug materials.

Temporary primitives are acceptable during implementation, but they must be replaced before the final completion pass for every important visible gameplay element.

The final project should contain an automated, reproducible asset-generation pipeline so that the project can regenerate its own original block textures, mob models, item models, materials, UI assets, and supporting content without requiring me to manually model or wire them in the Unity Inspector.

## Block texture generation

Programmatically generate original Minecraft-like pixel-art textures for all implemented blocks.

Target visual characteristics:

- approximately 16×16 pixel visual language;
- crisp nearest-neighbor filtering;
- no blurry bilinear filtering on pixel-art assets;
- coherent Minecraft-like color palette and contrast;
- recognizable texture families;
- distinct top / side / bottom faces where appropriate;
- biome tint support where useful;
- alpha cutout/transparency where appropriate;
- animated UV/frames for water, lava, portal, fire, or other animated materials where practical.

Generate actual texture assets inside the project, such as PNG files or Unity-generated texture assets, and automatically configure their import settings.

Create and use a texture atlas or texture-array based pipeline suitable for chunk meshing.

Important visible blocks must not remain as flat single-color materials.

## Mob model generation

Every important mob must have an actual recognizable **blocky articulated 3D model**.

Build mobs from generated cuboid meshes, rectangular body parts, procedural meshes, or an equivalent block-model system.

The final mob should be recognizable by silhouette before the texture is even considered.

Example conceptual rigs:

### Pig
- body;
- head;
- snout;
- ears;
- four legs.

### Cow
- body;
- head;
- muzzle;
- horns if useful;
- four legs;
- udder if practical.

### Sheep
- body;
- head;
- four legs;
- removable/wool-covered visual state if shearing exists.

### Chicken
- body;
- head;
- beak;
- wings;
- legs.

### Zombie
- head;
- torso;
- two arms;
- two legs.

### Skeleton
- skull/head;
- ribcage/torso;
- thin arms;
- thin legs;
- held bow where appropriate.

### Creeper
- head;
- tall torso;
- four lower legs.

### Enderman
- head;
- narrow torso;
- very long arms;
- very long legs;
- carried-block attachment point.

### Villager
- head;
- nose;
- torso/robe;
- folded/posed arms;
- legs.

### Ghast
- large cubic body;
- face;
- hanging tentacles.

### Blaze
- central body/head;
- multiple orbiting rods;
- animated rod motion.

### Shulker
- shell base;
- shell lid;
- interior head.

### Wither
- central body;
- three heads;
- segmented side body/tails where useful.

### Ender Dragon
Create a proper articulated blocky dragon model containing, at minimum:
- head;
- jaw;
- neck segments;
- torso;
- tail segments;
- left wing;
- right wing;
- legs/feet where useful.

The dragon must visibly animate in flight and during its boss behavior. Do not represent it as a single primitive mesh.

## Mob textures and materials

Generate original pixel-art mob textures/materials.

Do not extract or reuse Minecraft's original texture files.

Textures should nevertheless preserve the recognizable visual grammar of a block-based sandbox:
- low-resolution pixel style;
- readable face/eyes;
- coherent palette;
- creature-specific markings;
- damage/flash feedback if useful.

Create original variants when a mob has important visual variants.

## Reusable animation pipeline

Create reusable animation/rig systems for blocky creatures.

Support, where relevant:

- idle;
- walk;
- run;
- swim;
- fly;
- attack;
- hurt;
- death;
- look/head tracking;
- jump;
- special mob actions;
- boss-specific movement.

Do not consider a high-priority mob complete while it is represented by a Capsule, generic Unity primitive, or static unanimated placeholder.

Procedural animation is acceptable and may be preferable to large numbers of manually-authored animation clips.

## Held blocks

Blocks held by the player must render as actual 3D block geometry using the appropriate block material/texture.

The first-person held block should have:
- Minecraft-like scale;
- readable perspective;
- sensible position in the lower-right hand area;
- idle bob;
- equip motion;
- place/use feedback.

## Tools and weapons

Tools and weapons must have real visible geometry.

This includes, at minimum where implemented:

- swords;
- pickaxes;
- axes;
- shovels;
- hoes;
- spear;
- bow;
- crossbow;
- shield;
- trident;
- fishing rod.

Do **not** simply display a flat inventory icon in front of the camera as the final first-person item.

Preferred approaches include:
- extruded pixel/voxel geometry;
- thin blocky 3D meshes;
- procedural mesh generation;
- code-generated low-poly models.

Their silhouettes should resemble the expected Minecraft tool family while using original geometry/textures.

Implement first-person presentation:
- equip animation;
- hand/item bob;
- attack swing;
- mining swing;
- blocking/use pose;
- bow draw;
- spear attack/charge where relevant.

## Armor visuals

When armor is implemented, visible armor should appear on the player/entity model where practical.

Support recognizable visual differences between:
- leather;
- copper;
- gold;
- iron;
- diamond;
- netherite.

Do not require a sophisticated skinned-mesh pipeline if a generated blocky armor overlay can achieve a convincing result.

## Item icons

Automatically generate or render item icons for the inventory.

Prefer one of:
- procedural pixel icons;
- orthographic renders of generated 3D items;
- generated sprite-sheet assets.

Avoid hand-assigning hundreds of icons in the Inspector.

Every implemented item exposed in Creative inventory should have a usable icon whenever practical.

## UI asset generation

Generate the visual assets required for:

- hotbar;
- selected slot;
- inventory slots;
- Creative tabs;
- Survival inventory;
- crafting UI;
- furnace UI;
- hearts;
- hunger;
- armor;
- oxygen;
- XP bar;
- boss bars;
- buttons;
- tooltips;
- crosshair;
- search field;
- scrollbars.

The style should be original but strongly evoke a clean Minecraft-like pixel UI.

Do not leave the final UI as plain default Unity buttons/panels.

## Particle and VFX generation

Create simple original visual effects for important interactions:

- block breaking;
- block placement;
- item pickup;
- critical hit where implemented;
- mob damage;
- mob death;
- TNT explosion;
- Creeper explosion;
- portal particles;
- Ender/teleport particles;
- fire;
- smoke;
- torch/campfire effects;
- dragon death;
- Wither effects.

Favor cheap procedural particles over heavyweight dependencies.

## Generated prefabs and project assets

Use Unity Editor scripts to automatically generate and save, as appropriate:

- mob prefabs;
- block materials;
- block texture atlas/arrays;
- item prefabs;
- tool meshes;
- weapon meshes;
- armor visuals;
- particle systems;
- UI prefabs;
- animation clips/controllers;
- ScriptableObject/data assets;
- generated scenes or bootstrap objects.

Keep generated assets under a clearly named directory, for example:

```text
Assets/_Game/Generated/
  Textures/
  Materials/
  Meshes/
  Mobs/
  Items/
  UI/
  VFX/
  Animations/
```

The project must not depend on me manually assembling or reconnecting these generated assets in the Inspector.

## Asset regeneration

Create one reproducible Editor command/menu item or script entry point that can rebuild generated visual assets if needed.

For example:

```text
Tools > Opus 5.5 Minecraft > Rebuild Generated Assets
```

or an equivalent automated command.

Asset regeneration should be deterministic enough that rerunning it does not corrupt references or create uncontrolled duplicates.

## Blender usage

For this Minecraft-style Unity version, Blender is **not required** if procedural Unity-generated blocky assets provide better reliability.

However, if Blender is installed and programmatically accessible, you may use Blender Python for selected complex blocky models if it materially improves visual quality.

Do not introduce Blender as a mandatory manual workflow.

Any Blender-generated file must be automatically exported/imported into the Unity project and must not require me to perform manual Blender editing.

## Asset completion gate

Before final completion, inspect the actual visible result and explicitly verify:

- high-priority mobs are not primitive placeholders;
- held tools are not flat 2D placeholder sprites;
- visible blocks have real pixel-art textures;
- the Creative inventory has usable icons;
- Nether and End have dimension-specific materials/assets;
- Ender Dragon has a recognizable articulated model;
- Wither has a recognizable model;
- TNT has recognizable visuals and VFX;
- portals have animated/distinct materials;
- the HUD is not default Unity UI styling.

Add these checks to `FEATURE_MATRIX.md`.

If any requirement remains incomplete, mark it honestly as `PARTIAL` or `NOT IMPLEMENTED` rather than pretending that a primitive placeholder satisfies it.


# 31. Audio

Do not use copied Minecraft audio.

If practical, generate or synthesize simple original sounds for:
- footsteps by material family;
- block break/place;
- pickup;
- UI click;
- player hurt;
- mob hurt/death;
- bow;
- TNT fuse/explosion;
- portal;
- water/lava;
- key mob sounds.

Audio is lower priority than stable gameplay, but silence everywhere should be avoided if inexpensive procedural sound generation is possible.

---

# 32. Save/load — mandatory

Worlds and dimensions must persist.

Save:
- world seed;
- player position;
- game mode;
- inventory;
- health/hunger/XP;
- changed blocks;
- containers;
- time of day;
- entities where practical;
- dimension state;
- generated/modified chunk data.

Do not serialize every untouched procedurally-generated block. Save the seed plus modifications where practical.

Portaling between Overworld/Nether/End must preserve each dimension.

---

# 33. Performance and robustness

Avoid:
- one GameObject per block;
- unbounded entity spawning;
- rebuilding the whole world when one block changes;
- huge allocations every frame;
- expensive `FindObjectOfType` loops;
- excessive `Update` methods for thousands of entities.

Use:
- chunk data arrays;
- pooled entities;
- configurable render distance;
- sensible mob caps;
- chunk streaming;
- localized mesh rebuilds;
- frustum/distance awareness where practical.

Default settings should be suitable for screen recording.

---

# 34. Unity automation and validation

Find the local Unity Editor executable if possible.

Use automated validation where available:
- Unity batch mode;
- compilation;
- EditMode tests;
- PlayMode tests;
- build validation;
- log parsing.

Example strategy only; adapt paths/version automatically:
- launch Unity in `-batchmode`;
- open project;
- force asset import/compile;
- execute validation method;
- capture `Editor.log`;
- fix compile errors;
- repeat.

Do not assume "code looks correct" means it compiles.

If a Windows standalone development build can be produced reliably, create one under something like:

```text
Builds/Windows/
```

but prioritize a healthy Editor project first.

---

# 36. Development files you must maintain

Create/update:

## `DEVELOPMENT.md`
Include:
- engine version;
- architecture;
- how project bootstraps;
- exact controls;
- save location;
- major systems;
- build/run instructions;
- known limitations.

## `FEATURE_MATRIX.md`
Use a table with:
- Feature
- Status: `WORKING`, `PARTIAL`, `NOT IMPLEMENTED`
- Test notes

List all major requirements from this prompt honestly.

Do not label a feature WORKING merely because a class exists.

## `OPUS_5.5_FINAL_REPORT.md`
Create this at the very end with:
- overview;
- major implemented features;
- known bugs;
- exact controls;
- build/compile result;
- count of files added/changed if practical;
- rough lines of code if practical;
- session metrics described below.

---

# 37. Session timing, token accounting and API-equivalent cost

This section is mandatory because these numbers will be used in the YouTube comparison.

## Start timer BEFORE substantial work

At the very beginning of the task:

1. Read the current local timestamp from the operating system, not from memory.
2. Save it to:
   ```text
   .opus-5.5-run/start_time.txt
   ```
3. Also write the timestamp into `OPUS_5.5_FINAL_REPORT.md` later.

At the end:
1. read the current local timestamp again;
2. save it to:
   ```text
   .opus-5.5-run/end_time.txt
   ```
3. calculate wall-clock elapsed time.

Report:
- start timestamp;
- end timestamp;
- total elapsed wall-clock time in `HH:MM:SS`;
- total minutes.

The timer includes coding, tool calls, builds, debugging and waiting for commands/builds during this session.

## Token usage

At the end, make a best effort to obtain **real session usage**, not a guess.

Preferred sources, in order:
1. session/runtime usage telemetry exposed directly by Codex;
2. if available, the current Codex session JSONL/log under the user's Codex session directory (commonly under `~/.codex/sessions` or `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\sessions` on Windows);
3. another official local session-usage source.

Identify the current session carefully using working directory, timestamps/session IDs and recent activity.

Report separately where available:
- input tokens;
- cached input tokens;
- cache-write tokens;
- output tokens;
- reasoning tokens if reported separately;
- total tokens.

**Avoid double-counting cumulative token snapshots/events in session logs.**
Determine whether usage records are per-turn or cumulative before summing.

If exact token usage is not accessible, explicitly write:
`Exact token usage unavailable from the accessible runtime`
and provide only a clearly labeled estimate if a defensible estimate can be computed. Never fabricate precision.

## Claude Opus 5.5 API-equivalent token cost

For this benchmark, use the following **Standard Claude API text-token rates valid for Claude Opus 5.5 on 2026-09-25**:

- uncached input: **$4.00 per 1M tokens**
- cached input (cache hits and refreshes): **$0.20 per 1M tokens**
- cache writes: **$5.00 per 1M tokens** (5-minute cache; **$8.00 per 1M tokens** for the 1-hour cache)
- output: **$20.00 per 1M tokens**

Compute a **token-only API-equivalent USD cost**, not the user's actual ChatGPT subscription charge.

When the usage telemetry provides total input with cached/cache-write tokens as subsets, subtract the subsets appropriately so that tokens are not charged twice.

Base formula:

```text
non_cached_input = input_tokens - cached_input_tokens - cache_write_tokens

cost =
  (non_cached_input / 1,000,000 * 4.00)
+ (cached_input_tokens / 1,000,000 * 0.20)
+ (cache_write_tokens / 1,000,000 * 5.00)
+ (output_tokens / 1,000,000 * 20.00)
```

If the runtime reports token categories differently, adapt the formula to the actual semantics and explain it.

### Long-context API pricing

Claude Opus 5.5 includes the full **1M-token context window at standard pricing**: a 900K-token request is billed at the same per-token rate as a 9K-token request, so no long-context multiplier applies. Report the long-context adjustment as none.

If tool calls would have separate API fees and exact fees are not available from the session, keep the reported figure explicitly labeled **token-only API equivalent**.

## Metrics output format

# 38. Final behavior

Do not finish by simply saying that files were created.

Before final response:

1. inspect `FEATURE_MATRIX.md`;
2. run final compilation/validation;
3. fix any newly discovered compile errors;
4. confirm default mode is Creative;
5. confirm Creative inventory/spawn interface is accessible;
6. confirm Survival mode is accessible;
7. confirm portals and dimensions that are marked WORKING actually have code/content wired up;
8. write `OPUS_5.5_FINAL_REPORT.md`;
9. record session end metrics;
10. make a final Git commit if Git is configured and the project is healthy.

Then respond with a concise summary:
- what works;
- how to launch;
- key controls;
- what remains incomplete;
- elapsed time;
- tokens;
- API-equivalent cost.

Do not claim untested or partial features are complete.

# 39. Start now

Begin with project inspection, timestamp capture and architecture planning.

Then build the game.

Do not wait for additional confirmation from me unless an external permission/dialog/installation issue genuinely prevents progress.
